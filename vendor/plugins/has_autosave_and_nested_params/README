== AutosaveAssociation
Adds :autosave to the options for has_one and has_many associations,
which will automatically save the associated models after
the parent has been saved.

== NestedParams
Adds :nested_params to the options for has_one and has_many associations,
which allows attributes of the associated model to be set directly
with a hash to #attributes=.
