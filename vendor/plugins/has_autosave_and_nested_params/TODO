AutosaveAssociation:
- Wrap everything in a transaction:
  - Right now all saving is done within a transaction, also for non NestedParams enabled associations. This is bad.
    Need to think of a way to only wrap these in transactions.
  - Also atm the option to save without validations is no longer working, because we always use save!.
    Maybe set an instance variable indicating what kind of save we are doing, seems ugly maybe there's
    already such a kept around. Should only wrap association saving in a transaction if we are doing a normal save,
    if it's a save without validations it should also be saved without validations.
    Actually we can probably safely always save the association without validations because if the parent needs to be
    validated it will already validate the association and thus will only be saved if validations are turned off.
NestedParams:
- We don't need to support arrays of ids anymore, because when using the NestedParamsFormBuilder we always get a hash.
